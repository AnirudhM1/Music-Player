<h2>Search Page</h2>

The search page is empty by default, and on typing text in the search bar, all the relevant songs are displayed. The submit button onclick reveals all the details of the song, which can then be played and added to playlist if the user has logged in.
After adding songs to the playlist, the user should return to the Profile page to access his/her playlists from the list of playlists he/she has.

Non-logged in users do not have the functionality of add to playlist option.
